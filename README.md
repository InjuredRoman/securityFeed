# securityFeed
A Security Feed made to allow the user to see likely attacks (as determined by the <a href="https://cymon.io/">cymon api</a>) on a given hostname, with the additional ability for a user to see the associated location of a given attacker's IP address.
In addition to searching by hostname, the user may search by IP to yield all the attacks picked up from a particular IP address.

In addition to the aforementioned cymon api, a self proclaimed "tracker of malware, phishing, botnets, spam, and more", this project is powered by the <a href="https://github.com/istarkov/google-map-react">google-maps-react</a> component.
It was developed using react and redux.
